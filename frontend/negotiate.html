  <!-- Strategy overview -->
  <div class="strategy-box">
    <div class="strategy-title">⚡ Your Strategy: "Recalls + Research"</div>
    <p class="strategy-body">
      You have two strong data-backed leverage points: 2 open NHTSA recalls (one safety-critical) and documented market comps showing fair value at $16,800–$19,200. The seller has already shown flexibility (dropped from $20k). Lead with the recalls as a legitimate concern, not a trick — you're doing them a favor by flagging it. Don't reveal your walk-away price. Be friendly, not aggressive.

  <!-- Walk away -->
  <div class="walkaway-box">
    <h3>🚪 Know Your Walk-Away Point: $18,200</h3>
    <p>If the seller won't go below $18,200 AND cannot provide proof that the airbag recall was resolved, walk away. The airbag recall is safety-critical. That's not a negotiating point — it's a real risk. At $18,200 with unresolved safety recalls, this car is overpriced. There will be another Accord.</p>
